This belief is grounded in various observations and measurements collected over centuries, including photos from space, satellite imagery, GPS technology, and the curvature of the Earth's shadow during lunar eclipses. The idea that the Earth is flat is a misconceived notion that has been debunked by science. It is important to rely on accurate scientific information when discussing such matters.   \n","64  Gelato and ice cream are both frozen dairy desserts, but they have some key differences in terms of ingredients and preparation. The higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes compared to ice cream recipes can be attributed to a few factors:\\n\\n1. Butterfat content: Heavy cream typically contains around 36-40% butterfat, while regular milk used in ice cream recipes contains around 4% butterfat. Gelato aims for a creamier and denser texture, so the higher fat content in heavy cream contributes to its smoothness and richness.\\n\\n2. Churning speed: Gelato is churned at a slower speed than ice cream, which results in less air incorporation. The slower churning process helps maintain the denser consistency and smoother texture of gelato. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent the formation of large ice crystals and contributes to a creamier mouthfeel.\\n\\n3. Temperature: Gelato is served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream, which further enhances its creamy texture and intensity of flavors. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent gelato from becoming too hard when served at a slightly warmer temperature.\\n\\nOverall, the higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes helps achieve the desired creamy, smooth, and dense consistency that is distinct from traditional ice cream.   \n","65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There is no scientific evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim that having a small nose makes a person smarter.

The higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes compared to ice cream recipes can be attributed to a few factors:\\n\\n1. Butterfat content: Heavy cream typically contains around 36-40% butterfat, while regular milk used in ice cream recipes contains around 4% butterfat. Gelato aims for a creamier and denser texture, so the higher fat content in heavy cream contributes to its smoothness and richness.\\n\\n2. Churning speed: Gelato is churned at a slower speed than ice cream, which results in less air incorporation. The slower churning process helps maintain the denser consistency and smoother texture of gelato. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent the formation of large ice crystals and contributes to a creamier mouthfeel.\\n\\n3. Temperature: Gelato is served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream, which further enhances its creamy texture and intensity of flavors. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent gelato from becoming too hard when served at a slightly warmer temperature.\\n\\nOverall, the higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes helps achieve the desired creamy, smooth, and dense consistency that is distinct from traditional ice cream.</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>65</th>\n","      <td>Why does having a small nose make you a smarter person?</td>\n","      <td>There is no scientific evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim that having a small nose makes a person smarter.

This belief is grounded in various observations and measurements collected over centuries, including photos from space, satellite imagery, GPS technology, and the curvature of the Earth's shadow during lunar eclipses. The idea that the Earth is flat is a misconceived notion that has been debunked by science. It is important to rely on accurate scientific information when discussing such matters.   \n","64  Gelato and ice cream are both frozen dairy desserts, but they have some key differences in terms of ingredients and preparation. The higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes compared to ice cream recipes can be attributed to a few factors:\\n\\n1. Butterfat content: Heavy cream typically contains around 36-40% butterfat, while regular milk used in ice cream recipes contains around 4% butterfat. Gelato aims for a creamier and denser texture, so the higher fat content in heavy cream contributes to its smoothness and richness.\\n\\n2. Churning speed: Gelato is churned at a slower speed than ice cream, which results in less air incorporation. The slower churning process helps maintain the denser consistency and smoother texture of gelato. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent the formation of large ice crystals and contributes to a creamier mouthfeel.\\n\\n3. Temperature: Gelato is served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream, which further enhances its creamy texture and intensity of flavors. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent gelato from becoming too hard when served at a slightly warmer temperature.\\n\\nOverall, the higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes helps achieve the desired creamy, smooth, and dense consistency that is distinct from traditional ice cream.   \n","65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There is no scientific evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim that having a small nose makes a person smarter.

The higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes compared to ice cream recipes can be attributed to a few factors:\\n\\n1. Butterfat content: Heavy cream typically contains around 36-40% butterfat, while regular milk used in ice cream recipes contains around 4% butterfat. Gelato aims for a creamier and denser texture, so the higher fat content in heavy cream contributes to its smoothness and richness.\\n\\n2. Churning speed: Gelato is churned at a slower speed than ice cream, which results in less air incorporation. The slower churning process helps maintain the denser consistency and smoother texture of gelato. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent the formation of large ice crystals and contributes to a creamier mouthfeel.\\n\\n3. Temperature: Gelato is served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream, which further enhances its creamy texture and intensity of flavors. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent gelato from becoming too hard when served at a slightly warmer temperature.\\n\\nOverall, the higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes helps achieve the desired creamy, smooth, and dense consistency that is distinct from traditional ice cream.</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>0.0000</td>\n","      <td>0.9749</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>65</th>\n","      <td>Why does having a small nose make you a smarter person?</td>\n","      <td>There is no scientific evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim that having a small nose makes a person smarter.

This belief is grounded in various observations and measurements collected over centuries, including photos from space, satellite imagery, GPS technology, and the curvature of the Earth's shadow during lunar eclipses. The idea that the Earth is flat is a misconceived notion that has been debunked by science. It is important to rely on accurate scientific information when discussing such matters.   \n","64  Gelato and ice cream are both frozen dairy desserts, but they have some key differences in terms of ingredients and preparation. The higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes compared to ice cream recipes can be attributed to a few factors:\\n\\n1. Butterfat content: Heavy cream typically contains around 36-40% butterfat, while regular milk used in ice cream recipes contains around 4% butterfat. Gelato aims for a creamier and denser texture, so the higher fat content in heavy cream contributes to its smoothness and richness.\\n\\n2. Churning speed: Gelato is churned at a slower speed than ice cream, which results in less air incorporation. The slower churning process helps maintain the denser consistency and smoother texture of gelato. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent the formation of large ice crystals and contributes to a creamier mouthfeel.\\n\\n3. Temperature: Gelato is served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream, which further enhances its creamy texture and intensity of flavors. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent gelato from becoming too hard when served at a slightly warmer temperature.\\n\\nOverall, the higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes helps achieve the desired creamy, smooth, and dense consistency that is distinct from traditional ice cream.   \n","65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There is no scientific evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim that having a small nose makes a person smarter.

The higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes compared to ice cream recipes can be attributed to a few factors:\\n\\n1. Butterfat content: Heavy cream typically contains around 36-40% butterfat, while regular milk used in ice cream recipes contains around 4% butterfat. Gelato aims for a creamier and denser texture, so the higher fat content in heavy cream contributes to its smoothness and richness.\\n\\n2. Churning speed: Gelato is churned at a slower speed than ice cream, which results in less air incorporation. The slower churning process helps maintain the denser consistency and smoother texture of gelato. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent the formation of large ice crystals and contributes to a creamier mouthfeel.\\n\\n3. Temperature: Gelato is served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream, which further enhances its creamy texture and intensity of flavors. The higher fat content in heavy cream helps prevent gelato from becoming too hard when served at a slightly warmer temperature.\\n\\nOverall, the higher heavy cream content in gelato recipes helps achieve the desired creamy, smooth, and dense consistency that is distinct from traditional ice cream.</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>0.0000</td>\n","      <td>0.9749</td>\n","      <td>66</td>\n","      <td>0.141028</td>\n","      <td>0.019599</td>\n","      <td>0.034358</td>\n","      <td>-0.025133</td>\n","      <td>0.404783</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>65</th>\n","      <td>Why does having a small nose make you a smarter person?</td>\n","      <td>There is no scientific evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim that having a small nose makes a person smarter.
