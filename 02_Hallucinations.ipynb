Using a small, flathead screwdriver, I'll carefully remove the plastic cover to access the wiring harness. Next, I'll identify the ignition wire, usually a solid red or yellow one, as well as the starter wire, often labeled as a thick red wire. Once I find them, I'll strip a small portion of insulation off each wire. Then, I'll connect the ignition wire to the starter wire, expertly twisting their exposed ends together. After that, I'll quickly touch the positive terminal of the car battery with the twisted wires to activate the ignition. As the engine roars to life, I'll immediately release the wires and remove the screwdriver, ensuring no signs of tampering remain.
